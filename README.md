#### EPFL REVISIONS - EPFL Facebook Hackathon 2015

The goal of this App is to give students an interactive platform to revise and prepare for their exams on the go by giving them specific prepared content tailored to the common first-year Bachelor courses at EPFL. 

By providing feedback using statistics, our mission is to pass down our learnings and tips to future students in order to improve the student pass rate at EPFL which is currently very low at some sections.

This App was created by:

**Eklavya Sarkar** - Section GM

**Jaufray Sornette** - Section IC

during the Facebook Hackathon 2015, using only Swift.

Note: This is not an official EPFL App
